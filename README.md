# gpuRIR

**gpuRIR** is a free and open-source Python library for Room Impulse Response (RIR) simulation using the Image Source Method (ISM) with GPU acceleration. It can compute the RIRs between several source and receivers positions in parallel using CUDA GPUs. It is approximately 100 times faster than CPU implementations [[1]](#references).

## Prerequisites

* **OS**: It has been tested on GNU/Linux systems (Ubuntu and centOS) and Windows 10. Please, let me know if you successfully [install it on Mac OSX systems](https://github.com/DavidDiazGuerra/gpuRIR/issues/3).

* **Compilers**: To install the package you will need the [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) (it has been tested with the release 8.0 and 10.0 but it should work fine with any version that includes cuRAND) and a C++11 compiler, such as [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [MSVC++](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com).

* **CMake**: Finally, you will need, at least, the version 3.12 of [CMake](https://cmake.org/).  You can easily get it by `pip install cmake`.

* **Python**: It has been tested in Python 3, but should work fine with Python 2.

**Note for PyTorch users**: If you are going to use this module with PyTorch, the compiler you use to build gpuRIR must be ABI-compatible with the compiler PyTorch was built with, so you must use GCC version 4.9 and above.


## Installation
You can use `pip` to install **gpuRIR** from our repository through `pip install  https://github.com/DavidDiazGuerra/gpuRIR/zipball/master`. You can also clone or download our repository and run `python setup.py install`.

## Documentation

### `simulateRIR`

Room Impulse Responses (RIRs) simulation using the Image Source Method (ISM). For further details see [[1]](#references).

#### Parameters

* **room_sz** : *array_like with 3 elements.*
        Size of the room (in meters).
* **beta** : *array_like with 6 elements.*
        Reflection coefficients of the walls as $[beta_{x0}, beta_{x1}, beta_{y0}, beta_{y1}, beta_{z0}, beta_{z1}]$, where $beta_{x0}$ and $beta_{x1}$ are the reflection coefficents of the walls orthogonal to the x axis at x=0 and x=room_sz[0], respectively.
* **pos_src**, **pos_rcv** : *ndarray with 2 dimensions and 3 columns.*
        Position of the sources and the receivers (in meters).
* **nb_img** : *array_like with 3 integer elements*
        Number of images to simulate in each dimension.
* **Tmax** : *float*
        RIRs length (in seconds).
* **fs** : *float*
        RIRs sampling frequency (in Hertz).
* **Tdiff** : *float, optional*
        Time (in seconds) when the ISM is replaced by a diffuse reverberation model. Default is Tmax (full ISM simulation).
* **spkr_pattern** : *{"omni", "homni", "card", "hypcard", "subcard", "bidir"}, optional.*
        Polar pattern of the sources (the same for all of them).
* **mic_pattern** : *{"omni", "homni", "card", "hypcard", "subcard", "bidir"}, optional.*
	Polar pattern of the receivers (the same for all of them).
	* *"omni"* : Omnidireccional (default).
	* *"homni"*: Half omnidirectional, 1 in front of the microphone, 0 backwards.
	* *"card"*: Cardioid.
	* *"hypcard"*: Hypercardioid.
	* *"subcard"*: Subcardioid.
	* *"bidir"*: Bidirectional, a.k.a. figure 8.
* **orV_src** : *ndarray with 2 dimensions and 3 columns or None, optional.*
        Orientation of the sources as vectors pointing in the same direction. Applies to each source. None (default) is only valid for omnidirectional patterns.
* **orV_rcv** : *ndarray with 2 dimensions and 3 columns or None, optional.*
        Orientation of the receivers as vectors pointing in the same direction. Applies to each receiver. None (default) is only valid for omnidirectional patterns.
* **c** : *float, optional.*
        Speed of sound (in m/s). The default is 343.0.

#### Returns

*3D ndarray*
        The first axis is the source, the second the receiver and the third the time.

#### Warnings

Asking for too much and too long RIRs (specially for full ISM simulations) may exceed the GPU memory and crash the kernel.

### `simulateTrajectory`

Filter an audio signal by the RIRs of a motion trajectory recorded with a microphone array.

#### Parameters

* **source_signal** : *array_like.*
	Signal of the moving source.
* **RIRs** : *3D ndarray*
	Room Impulse Responses generated with simulateRIR.
* **timestamps** : *array_like, optional*
	Timestamp of each RIR [s]. By default, the RIRs are equispaced through the trajectory.
* **fs** : *float, optional*
	Sampling frequency (in Hertz). It is only needed for custom timestamps.

#### Returns

*2D ndarray*
	Matrix with the signals captured by each microphone in each column.

### `activateMixedPrecision`

Activate the mixed precision mode, only for Pascal GPU architecture or superior.

#### Parameters

* **activate** : *bool, optional.*
        True for activate and Flase for deactivate. True by default.

### `activateLUT`

Activate the lookup table for the sinc computations.

#### Parameters

* **activate** : *bool, optional.*
        True for activate and Flase for deactivate. True by default.

### `beta_SabineEstimation`

* **abs_weights** : *array_like with 6 elements, optional.*
        Absorption coefficient ratios of the walls (the default is [1.0]*6). 

#### Returns

*ndarray with 6 elements.*
        Reflection coefficients of the walls as $[beta_{x0}, beta_{x1}, beta_{y0}, beta_{y1}, beta_{z0}, beta_{z1}]$, where $beta_{x0}$ and $beta_{x1}$ are the reflection coefficents of the walls orthogonal to the x axis at x=0 and x=room_sz[0], respectively.

### `att2t_SabineEstimator`

#### Parameters
